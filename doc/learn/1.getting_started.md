# Getting started

## Start from nothing
To understand ngl, let's start from nothing with an analogy with our world.

You are a human able to describe things, an **ngl:entity**

You are stored in the universe, an **ngl:storage**
The universe contains everything from your perspective so it's a specific storage, an **ngl:environment**

But what is a *thing* ?, an **ngl:data**

In this universe, there is rules (gravity, subatomic interactions, speed limits ...), those are **ngl:rule**

Things are different, they have a shape you can identify, an **ngl:shape**

There is interactions between those things(a thing moving in the universe, a collision ...), 
those interactions are represented by **ngl::edge**

Now we have a *living* universe, so let's be more specific about us.

You are an **ngl:entity** (an **ngl:data** able to act) \
You create **ngl:edge** with other **ngl:data** \
Those data from your perspective are **ngl:concrete** (physical) \
The representation of those concrete data are **ngl:concept**. For example, when you observe
Mars (a concrete data ), you will identify a planet in your mind (a concept)

From your perspective, a planet in the universe is a concrete data, a planet in your mind is
a concept. But the concept of the planet in your mind is a concrete data from the universe
perspective, it physically exists in your brain.

### Programming perspective
- Your are an ngl:entity
- A compiler is an ngl:entity
- Your program idea is a ngl:concept
- Your OS is the ngl:environment of your program
- Your source code is the ngl:concrete of your ngl:concept
- The compiler will read your concrete source code, its internal representation is the concept
- The compiler will write its concept to a ngl:storage (filesystem)

## hello world
```
// ngl.ngl
// the compiler will read the ngl source code first
ngl:cluster main
ngl:cluster:import<program> // connect the program cluster to this one

// hello_world.ngl
ngl:cluster main

ngl::program
{
    ngl::print<"Hello World !">
}
```

```
hello_world/program.ngl
hello_world/ngl.ngl

nglc hello_world/
```
